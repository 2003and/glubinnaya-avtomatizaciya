"I doubt it; I sincerely and utterly doubt it." Mr. Croup ran a hand through his lank
orange hair. "No, my fine friend, I was thinking metaphorically—more along the lines
of the birds they take down mines." Mr. Vandemar nodded, comprehension dawning
slowly: yes, a canary. Mr. Ross had no other resemblance to a canary. He was huge—
almost as big as Mr. Vandemar—and extremely grubby, and quite hairless, and he said
very little, although he had made a point of telling each of them that he liked to kill
things, and he was good at it; and this amused Mr. Croup and Mr. Vandemar. But he
was a canary, and he never knew it. So Mr. Ross went first, in his filthy T-shirt and his
crusted blue-jeans, and Croup and Vandemar walked behind him, in their elegant black
suits.
There are four simple ways for the observant to tell Mr. Croup and Mr. Vandemar
apart: first, Mr. Vandemar is two and a half heads taller than Mr. Croup; second, Mr.
Croup has eyes of a faded china blue, while Mr. Vandemar's eyes are brown; third,
while Mr. Vandemar fashioned the rings he wears on his right hand out of the skulls of
four ravens, Mr. Croup has no obvious jewelery; fourth, Mr. Croup likes words, while
Mr. Vandemar is always hungry. Also, they look nothing at all alike.
